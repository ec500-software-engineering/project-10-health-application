# Health Application

In this project, we will build a health advisor based on patterns your phone knows about you. We will build an Android App and utilize the AI kernel model developed in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/morrisb/what-does-your-smartphone-know-about-you) to analyse your daily activities, then give you health advices.
