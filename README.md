# Health Application

In this project, we will build a health advisor based on patterns your phone knows about you. We will build an Android App and utilize the AI kernel model developed in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/morrisb/what-does-your-smartphone-know-about-you) to analyse your daily activities, then give you health advices.

## User Story
As an user of Health app, I will most likely to use it to monitor my daily activities:
- Display six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) if possible
- Display the distance of performing each activity
- Calculate the corresponding calories consumption for each activity
- Sum up the calories for all activity and generate a final score
- Able to set up a health goal(plan) for a period of time
- Compare the goal and actual score in real life to see if accomplishment checks.
